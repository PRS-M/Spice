## General Info
A restaurant website created with ASP.NET MVC Core. Just a CRUD app coded along with the course.  
Not much, just enough to notice and acknowledge the differences between .NET and .NET Core.  
I think I will refactor the whole project so my eyes stop hurting, especially the naming conventions.

## Technologies
* C#
* .NET Core
* ASP.NET MVC Core
* Entity Framework Core
